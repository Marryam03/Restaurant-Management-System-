Project Idea:
The restaurant keeps a catalogue of the food and beverage products that it offers. In addition to delivering cuisine on their premises, the restaurant accepts orders online via their website. We have delivery boys that help us deliver the orders. Each delivery boy is allocated a different area code. The delivery boy cannot deliver outside of the area that has not been given to him (each delivery boy may only have one area assigned to him). The client record is kept so that premium customers can receive discounts.
Project Objective:
The project's goal is to provide a complete restaurant management system that simplifies operations, enhances customer experience, and gives important insights through data analysis. A digital catalogue with detailed information about food and beverage items, an online ordering system with a user-friendly interface, a delivery management system with delivery boys assigned to specific area codes, a customer record management system to maintain customer profiles, and a discount management system to provide discounts to eligible customers will all be part of the system. The technology will also allow premium clients to be identified and recognized for special incentives and discounts.
